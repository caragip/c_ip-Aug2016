		//		it will split at spaces and return an array of ["I","like","apples!"]
		// Example 2: "I really like really red apples".split("really")
		//		it will split at the word "really" and return an array of ["I "," like "," red apples!"]

		 * use String.split to split up the sandwich at the spaces, " ", and return what's in the middle of the sandwich and ignores what's on the outside
